## Installation

To get started, follow these instructions to install the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (v20.0.0 or higher)
- npm (v10.0.0 or higher)

### Steps

1. Creating your branch:

   I. For Organization Members:

   - **Branch Creation:** As an organization member, when working on a new feature or task, you should create a new branch from the "develop" branch.
     The branch name should be in the format `feature-` where `<description>` represents a short description of the task or feature you are working
     on. For example, if you are adding a login feature, the branch name could be `feature-login`.
   - **Code Implementation:** Implement the necessary changes and new features on your created branch. Make sure to adhere to the organization's
     coding standards and best practices.
   - **Code Testing:** Thoroughly test your changes on the branch to ensure that they work as expected and do not introduce any bugs or issues.
   - **Code Review:** If required by the organization's development process, request a code review from your peers to ensure code quality and
     adherence to project guidelines.
   - **Pull Request Creation:** Once you are confident that your code is complete and tested, create a pull request to merge your changes from the
     `feature-*` branch into the `develop` branch. Clearly explain the purpose and scope of the changes in the pull request description.

   II. For External Contributors:

   - **Forking the Repository:** If you are an external contributor, you should fork the repository to your GitHub account. This will create a copy of
     the repository under your account, which you can use to make changes and submit pull requests.

   - **Branch Creation:** After forking the repository, create a new branch from the `develop` branch. The branch name should be in the format
     `feature-` where `<description>` represents a short description of the task or feature you are working on. For example, if you are adding a login
     feature, the branch name could be `feature-login`.

   - **Code Implementation:** Implement the necessary changes and new features on your created branch. Make sure to adhere to the organization's
     coding standards and best practices.

   - **Code Testing:** Thoroughly test your changes on the branch to ensure that they work as expected and do not introduce any bugs or issues.

   - **Code Review:** If required by the organization's development process, request a code review from your peers to ensure code quality and
     adherence to project guidelines.

   - **Pull Request Creation:** Once you are confident that your code is complete and tested, create a pull request to merge your changes from the
     `feature-*` branch into the `develop` branch. Clearly explain the purpose and scope of the changes in the pull request description.

2. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sagargupta16/My_Journey.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd my_journey

   npm run fb-install
   ```

5. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Open the application in your browser:
